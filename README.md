# Chaining-Methods

In the last assignment, your code might have looked something like this:

user1.display_info()
user1.enroll()
user1.spend_points(50)
user1.display_info()
user2.enroll()
user2.spend_points(80)
user2.display_info()
copy
This takes up a lot of space and we're repeating our call to user1 and user2 many times. 

Short-cut!
There is a way to call on user1 just once and keep attaching new method calls to the end of the previous one, like so:

user1.display_info().enroll().spend_points(50).display_info()
user2.enroll().spend_points(80).display_info()copy
This is called chaining. In order for this to work, each method must return self. By returning self, if we recall how functions work, each method call will now be equal to the instance that called it.

For example if user1.spend_points(50) returns its own instance (user1 ), then we can call one of that instance's methods after that call, like user1.spend_points(50).display_info().

class User:
    # .. constructor
    
    def display_info(self):
        # your code
    
    	# new return statement, returns this same object
        return self
copy
The practice of having OOP return its own instance is pretty common and is done in other programming languages, though the variable name in some languages is not self, but instead this.

Note: This only works with methods that do not need to return anything. If your method needs to return something other than self, it is not possible to chain the method.

Update your previous assignment so that each instance's methods are chained
